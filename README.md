# CMSconverter

This script creates stating HTML pages. It takes the content from .txt files in indicated folder, compares them between each other and creates .html files with inserted appripriate for each file relative links to relevant content, links to directory (subfolder of the file in it's source folder) and schema.org tags.

It spent 200 minutes on 2600 files totally 16 MB heavy. 

There is room for improvement, mainly in shrinking the area of comparison for eahc file from all the files to only files with similar unique words within them.

Further development is possible but not yet scheduled.
